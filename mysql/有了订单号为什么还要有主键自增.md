You do not *need* an auto-incremented id, because you have one.  However, I am a big fan of synthetic primary keys:

- They define a sequence for the inserts, so you know what rows were most efficient.
- 4-byte integers (if your table is not really big) is more efficient for foreign key indexes than longer character strings.
- If one of the unique order ids changes, a synthetic primary key makes it easy to change the value.
- You are isolated from future changes in the order-key-generating system.
- If you mysql the primary key is generally the clustered index.   Hence, inserts with a synthetic key go to the end of the table -- which  is efficient.  Inserts with an outside key might be out-of-order --  which is inefficient
