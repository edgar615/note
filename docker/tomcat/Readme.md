tutum-docker-tomcat

Deploy to Tutum

Base docker image to run a Tomcat application server
Image tags

    tutum/tomcat:latest
    tutum/tomcat:8.0
    tutum/tomcat:7.0
    tutum/tomcat:6.0
    tutum/tomcat:5.5
    tutum/tomcat:4.1

Usage

To create the image tutum/tomcat, execute the following command on the tutum-docker-tomcat folder:

docker build -t tutum/tomcat .

To run the image and bind to port :

docker run -d -p 8080:8080 tutum/tomcat

The first time that you run your container, a new user admin with all privileges will be created in Tomcat with a random password. To get the password, check the logs of the container by running:

docker logs <CONTAINER_ID>

You will see an output like the following:

========================================================================
You can now connect to this Tomcat server using:

    admin:b1uKcRK3r6SF

Please remember to change the above password as soon as possible!
========================================================================

In this case, b1uKcRK3r6SF is the password allocated to the admin user.

You can now login to you admin console to configure your tomcat server:

http://127.0.0.1:8080/manager/html
http://127.0.0.1:8080/host-manager/html

Setting a specific password for the admin account

If you want to use a preset password instead of a random generated one, you can set the environment variable TOMCAT_PASS to your specific password when running the container:

docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -e TOMCAT_PASS="mypass" tutum/tomcat

You can now test your deployment:

http://127.0.0.1:8080/

Done!
